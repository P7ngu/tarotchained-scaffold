## Introduction

**Fool‚Äôs Journey** is an interactive visual novel and narrative-driven game that explores the personal journey of self-discovery and acceptance of a queer protagonist. Drawing heavily from the symbolism of tarot cards, the game merges storytelling, exploration, and metaphorical depth to create an inclusive, educational, and emotionally resonant experience primarily aimed at young LGBTQ+ players seeking representation and empowerment.

---

## Concept

"Fool‚Äôs Journey" invites players into a symbolic quest where the protagonist‚Äîgender-neutral and named by the player‚Äîbegins a path from confusion to clarity through a tarot card reading that reflects themes of resilience, history, and identity within the LGBTQ+ community. Rather than predicting the future, the tarot reading reveals the struggles and triumphs of those who came before, grounding the player‚Äôs journey in collective memory and personal growth.

---

## Story and Narrative

The game opens with the protagonist in a dark room, standing before a closet‚Äîan explicit metaphor for the "closet" in LGBTQ+ culture. Upon opening the closet, the protagonist finds a worn, colorless tarot card: The Fool. This card marks the start of the journey, representing the early stages of self-discovery, uncertainty, and the courage to begin.

Accompanying the card is a cryptic riddle leading the protagonist to a bustling market, where they meet an enigmatic tarot reader. This figure offers a unique reading: cards telling not of fate but of the past‚Äîthe stories and symbols of the LGBTQ+ rights movement.

Each tarot card drawn introduces a character or historic event tied to LGBTQ+ history, conveyed through evocative illustrations, text, and symbolic fragments. Through this layered narrative, the protagonist realizes they are part of a larger story, gaining confidence and readiness to embrace their true self. The final transformation sees the Fool card regain its vibrant colors‚Äîsymbolizing wholeness and self-acceptance.

---

## Gameplay Mechanics

* **Exploration:** The game unfolds over two main scenes‚Äîthe Prologue, serving as onboarding, and the Main Scene, where players interact with the tarot card reading and exchange cards.
* **Tarot Cards:** Each card represents a core theme from the queer experience‚Äîidentity, love, hope, resilience‚Äîand is accompanied by custom pixel art illustrations and insightful narratives.
* **Progression:** By collecting and understanding all the cards, players symbolically complete their own journey toward acceptance, mirroring the protagonist‚Äôs path.
